								<li><p>As the attrition rate is higher among entry-level employees, it is essential for the company to pay attention to the specific challenges faced by new employees. Implementing mentorship programs, providing clear career progression paths, and creating a supportive work environment can help alleviate issues faced by junior employees, enhancing their overall experience and reducing turnover.</p></li>
								<li><p>The data shows that a significant percentage of employees who left had low-level salaries. Increasing the monthly salary for these employees could be an effective strategy to enhance their motivation to stay with the company. Conducting salary reviews and offering competitive compensation packages that align with industry standards may help prevent turnover among employees at the lower salary level.</p></li>
								<li><p>The dashboard indicates a high attrition rate within the sales department, with approximately 40% of sales representatives leaving the company. It is crucial to conduct an in-depth analysis of the reasons behind this trend. Identifying and addressing any challenges specific to the sales team, such as unreasonable sales targets, lack of incentives, or insufficient training, can help reduce turnover and improve overall sales performance.</p></li>
